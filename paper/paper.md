# Summary

Clinical researchers are often overly optimistic with regards to their institutions capacity to enroll participants into their trials. A common failing point in clinical trials is thus poor recruitment, which leads to extended trial duration, and concomitantly increased costs. In the worst case, the trial may be shut down before enough participants have been recruited to show an effect [@fogel2018]. Amongst other things, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline addendum E6 (R2) highlights the need for risk based monitoring, which partially addresses this topic. Appropriate monitoring should identify the problem early, providing a chance to optimise the recruitment strategy and/or initiate new trial sites. `accrualPlot` provides tools to summarize recruitment and predict the end date for the target sample size, thereby assisting with monitoring the risk of poor recruitment. `accrualPlot` is available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=accrualPlot) and additional information is available at the [package site](https://ctu-bern.github.io/accrualPlot/).

# Example usage

`accrualPlot` is installed via `install.packages("accrualPlot")`, and loaded into the R session via `library(accrualPlot)`. 

The package includes a demonstration data set called `accrualdemo`, which we shall use to show the features of the package.




```r
data("accrualdemo")
```

The first step to using `accrualPlot` is to create an `accrual_df` as follows. At this point, if we know when each site opened, we can pass a vector of dates to the `start_date` argument. We can also indicate the current date (via the `current_date` argument), which can be relevant when there have been no new participants enrolled recently. The `by`, `start_date` and `current_date` arguments are all optional.


```r
acc <- accrual_create_df(enrollment_dates = accrualdemo$date, 
                         by = accrualdemo$site, 
                         start_date = c("Site 1" = as.Date("2020-07-01"), 
                                        "Site 2" = as.Date("2020-07-13"), 
                                        "Site 3" = as.Date("2020-08-25")))
```

A short summary table of recruitment at the sites (if entered, only overall otherwise) is accessed via `summary`.


```r
summary(acc, header = FALSE)
```

```
##      name start_date time   n  rate
## 1  Site 1  01Jul2020    3 141 42.30
## 2  Site 2  13Jul2020    3  88 30.00
## 3  Site 3  25Aug2020    2  21 14.00
## 4 Overall  01Jul2020    3 250 75.00
```

We can also plot the cumulative (by default for individual sites and overall) and absolute recruitment (per day, week, month, etc).


```r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(acc)
plot(acc, which = "abs")
```

It is also possible predict the date at which the recruitment target would be achieved by setting `which = "pred"` and the `target` argument. 


```r
plot(acc, which = "pred", target = 500, 
     center_legend = "strip")
```

![](paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

By default, the most recent observation gets most weight and oldest the least (i.e. `seq(1/N, 1, by = 1/N)`). To change that to the last 30 days where each day gets equal weight, for example, pass a function to the `wfun` argument which returns the appropriate weights.


```r
plot(acc, which = "pred", target = 500, 
     wfun = function(x) ifelse(x$Date > (max(x$Date) - 30), 1, 0))
```

![](paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

For those that prefer `ggplot2` graphics, the `engine = "ggplot"` argument to `plot` can be used to return `ggplot` objects instead of base graphics plots. Dedicated functions for each plot in both 'engines' also exist, so the use of `plot` is not strictly necessary. We show an example of using the function to create the `ggplot2` variants below, including using the dedicated function for the prediction plot.


```r
library(patchwork)
(plot(acc, engine = "ggplot") + 
    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  plot(acc, "abs", engine = "ggplot") + 
    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "bottom")) /
  gg_accrual_plot_predict(acc, target = 500)
```

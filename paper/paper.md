# Summary

Clinical researchers are often overly optimistic with regards to their institutions capacity to enroll participants into their trials. A common failing point in clinical trials is thus poor recruitment, which leads to extended trial duration, with concomitant costs, and potentially to shutting a trial down before enough participants have been recruited to show an effect (@fogel2018). The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline addendum E6 (R2) highlights the need for risk based monitoring. `accrualPlot` provides tools to summarize recruitment and predict the end date for the target sample size, thereby assisting with monitoring the risk of poor recruitment. `accrualPlot` is available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=accrualPlot) and additional information is available at the [package site](https://ctu-bern.github.io/accrualPlot/).

# Example usage
`accrualPlot` is installed via `install.packages("accrualPlot")`, and loaded into the R session via `library(accrualPlot)`. 

First, we generate some data to demonstrate the package's functionality. We will generate 50 participants from 3 sites, where one site performs worse than the others. In normal use, the data is derived from the trial database.




```r
dat <- data.frame(date = as.Date("2020-07-01") + sample(1:100, 50),
                  site = sample(c("Site 1", "Site 2", "Site 3"), 50, 
                                replace = TRUE, prob = c(.4, .35, .15)))
```

The first step to using `accrualPlot` is to create an `accrual_df` as follows. At this point, if we know when each site opened, we can pass a vector of dates to the `start_date` argument. We can also indicate the current date (via the `current_date` argument), which can be relevant when there have been no new participants enrolled recently. The `by`, `start_date` and `current_date` arguments are all optional.


```r
acc <- accrual_create_df(enrollment_dates = dat$date, 
                         by = dat$site, 
                         start_date = c("Site 1" = as.Date("2020-07-01"), 
                                        "Site 2" = as.Date("2020-07-13"), 
                                        "Site 3" = as.Date("2020-06-20")))
```

A short summary table of recruitment at the sites (if entered, only overall otherwise) is accessed via `summary`.


```r
summary(acc)
```

```
##      name           start_date            time                    n
## 1  Center First participant in Months accruing Participants accrued
## 2  Site 1            01Jul2020               3                   24
## 3  Site 2            13Jul2020               3                   17
## 4  Site 3            20Jun2020               4                    9
## 5 Overall            20Jun2020               4                   50
##                       rate
## 1 Accrual rate (per month)
## 2                     7.42
## 3                     6.00
## 4                     2.50
## 5                    13.89
```

We can also plot the cumulative (by default for individual sites and overall) and absolute recruitment (per day, week, month, etc).


```r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(acc)
plot(acc, which = "abs")
```

It is also possible predict the date at which the recruitment target would be achieved by setting `which = "pred"` and the `target` argument.


```r
plot(acc, which = "pred", target = 75)
```

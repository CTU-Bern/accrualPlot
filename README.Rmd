Accrual plots are an important tool when monitoring clinical trials. Some trials are terminated early due to low accrual, which is a waste of resources (including time). Assessing accrual rates can also be useful for planning analyses and estimating how long a trial needs to continue recruiting participants.  `accrualPlot` provides tools for such plots

## Installation

<!-- `accrualPlot` can be installed from CRAN in the usual manner: -->

The package can be installed from the CTU Bern universe via

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('accrualPlot', repos = 'https://ctu-bern.r-universe.dev')
```


## Overview
The first step to using `accrualPlot` is to create an accrual dataframe. This is simply a dataframe with a counts of participants included per day.

```{r}
# load package
library(accrualPlot)

# generate some data
set.seed(1234)
x <- as.Date("2020-12-07") + sample(c(-20:20), 50, replace = TRUE)

df <- accrual_create_df(x)

```

Cumulative and absolute recruitment plots , as well as a method to predict the time point of study completion, are included.

```{r, fig.height=3}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(df, which = "cum")
plot(df, which = "abs")
plot(df, which = "pred", target = 100)
```

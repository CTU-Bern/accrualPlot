Accrual plots are an important tool when monitoring clinical trials. Some trials are terminated early due to low accrual, which is a waste of resources (including time). Assessing accrual rates can also be useful for planning analyses and estimating how long a trial needs to continue recruiting participants.  `accrualPlot` provides tools for such plots

## Installation

`accrualPlot` can be installed from CRAN in the usual manner:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('accrualPlot')
```

The development version of the package can be installed from the CTU Bern universe via

```{r universe-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('accrualPlot', repos = c('https://ctu-bern.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

`accrualPlot` can be installed directly from from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/accrualPlot")
```

Note that `remotes` treats any warnings (e.g. that a certain package was built under a different version of R) as errors. If you see such an error, run the following line and try again:

```{r remotes-error, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = "true")
```

## Overview
The first step to using `accrualPlot` is to create an accrual dataframe. This is simply a dataframe with a counts of participants included per day.

```{r}
# load package
library(accrualPlot)

# demonstration data
data(accrualdemo)

df <- accrual_create_df(accrualdemo$date)

```

Cumulative and absolute recruitment plots , as well as a method to predict the time point of study completion, are included.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7.5}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(df, which = "cum")
plot(df, which = "abs")
plot(df, which = "pred", target = 300)
```
